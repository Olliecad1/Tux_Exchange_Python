## Tux Exchange Python Script Connecting to Tux Public and Private api

## The Private api needs public and private keys to access

The Private and Public Script can be adjusted to what you want to get out of it

By the way this is written for Python 2.7

Go into the TuxExchangePrivateAPI directory and download all the files in that directory


Next you will need to put your Public Key in the PublKey.txt file and your Private Key in the PrivKey.txt file, after that just run the python script
